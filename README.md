This is all work in progress, only a few of my scripts will be deployed.
They are also just going to be deployed, if I think, that they are finished.

# sidebar.js
>**RAM usage:** *28.20 GB*

This script lets you add new items to the sidebar menu.

2 arguments are needed, the first one is the item's name and the second one is a script to call.
